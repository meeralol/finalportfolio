        <p>SWIE is a student run and Econ department sponsored organization formed to support and empower women interested in economics. We host professional, academic, and social events to help our members in the classroom, their careers, and beyond.
        </p>

        <p><br>Economics is the largest major within LSA, and men who major in economics outnumber females 2:1. Our goal is to imporve this statistic by providing support through our various events.<br></p>

        <p><br>The percentage of women in most majors including STEM majors has increased, but the percentage of women in economics has remained costant for approxtimately 40 years. Economics is a field with one of the highest median salaries; increasing the women in the field could help women earn more in their careers.<br></p>
